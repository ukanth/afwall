Bug Reports
-----------

Please check GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/issues) section for existing bugs and in case you like to submit a new one. Feature requests are also welcome. 

Before you report any problem/bug, take a look into the [how-to-report a bug](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-Report-Bug) section.

Limitations
-----------

* A firewall cannot protect against attacks that are performed outside the operating point. For example, if there is a Point-to-Point connection to the Internet.
* A firewall cannot prevent corporate data from being copied to a memory stick or HDD, and having these removed from the building. 
* AFWall+ does not scan for virus/malware that may exist in the files that pass through it, because it is a firewall and not an antivirus solution.
* AFWall+ is not an ad-blocker.
* Some apps/script which are running under admin rights might bypassing AFWall because they overwrite the system own IPtables with their own rules. Make sure you only give trusted application superuser rights, most "su"-solutions have companion apps which showing which apps are running under which rights like MagisK, Chainfire's su etc.

Compatibility
-------------

AFWall+ has been successfully tested under Android versions 4.x - 9.x. and is reported to work with most Android variants, including stock or exotic ROMs.

We do not recommend using AFWall+ in combination with any of the similar solutions (Avast, Kaspersky, NetGuard etc) because this could result in conflicts or even data leaks (e.g. IPtables could get overwritten).

Upgrading
---------

The upgrading mechanism is really simple, basically you can just "over-install" the new version over the old one, however this is the best pratice (which we recommended):

* **Make a backup of the current version** (e.g. via Titanium Backup).
* **Do not remove the current version** (otherwise your settings might getting reset).
* Download the latest AFWall+ version.
* Install the new version over the previous version.
* Done!

Permissions
-----------

AFWall+ asks for the following [Android permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview):

* RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: Autostart (Bootup) AFWall+ after the system finishes booting.
* ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Allows AFWall+ to access information about networks (iptables).
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Allows AFWall+ to write to external storage for debug log and export iptables rules.
* INTERNET: NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces() needs android.permission.INTERNET. This is just being used to get the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses/subnets for each interface, so the LAN address ranges can be determined. Nothing is actually trying to access the network. Also take a look at [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17252018/getting-my-lan-ip-address-192-168-xxxx-ipv4).
* ACCESS_WIFI_STATE: Used to detect the tether state.
* DEPRECATED ~~ACCESS_SUPERUSER: Standard to support Superuser/SuperSU (by Koushik/Chainfire)~~

Compiling the APK
---------------

Prerequisites:

* Android SDK in your $PATH (both platform-tools/ and tools/ directories)
* Javac 1.7 (or higher) and a recent version of Apache ant in your $PATH
* Git should be added in your $PATH
* Use the Android SDK Manager to install API 19 (or higher)

Quick start:

    git clone git://github.com/ukanth/afwall
    cd afwall
    ./gradlew clean assembleDebug

For complete instructions, please take a look at the [Wiki's How To Compile AFWAll section](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-Compile-AFWall).

## Compiling Native Binaries

You can compile the external binaries like BusyBox or the IPtables yourself, on the host side, you'll need to install the following:

* [NDK r10](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html), nominally under /opt/android-ndk-r10
* Host-side gcc 4.7, make, etc. (Red Hat 'Development Tools' group or Debian build-essential)
* autoconf, automake, and libtool

This command will build the Android binaries and copy them into `res/raw/`:

    make -C external NDK=/opt/android-ndk-r10
