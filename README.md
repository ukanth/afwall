Description
-----------

Android Firewall+ is an advanced iptables editor (GUI) for Android. It provides fine-grained control over which Android apps are allowed to access the network.

The original codebase was derived from [DroidWall](http://code.google.com/p/droidwall) by Rodrigo Rosauro. DroidWall was sold to AVAST in December 2011, and is no longer actively maintained.

For more information and community discussions, please visit the [XDA thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1957231) or [our Wiki](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki).

Features
--------
* Support 4.x/5.x and 6.x versions of Android
* Easy to install & simple to use
* Free and open source
* No advertisements
* Choose your preferred language
* Search for installed applications
* Sort installed applications by installed date/UID/alphabatical order
* Get a notification for any newly installed application with internet permission
* Blocked packets notification and filter
* Password protection
* Device Admin Support (Protect AFWall+ from uninstall)
* Easy to manage your rules with a custom script
* IPv4/IPv6 support
* WiFi, wireless data, LAN, VPN, tether, and roaming support
* Tasker and Locale support
* Firewall Logs service
* Multi-User (multiple-profiles) support
* Built-in iptables/BusyBox
* Export and import rules (Import All Rules needs donate version)
* Option to prevent data leaks during boot (requires init.d support or S-OFF)
* Supports ARM/MIPS/x86

Bug Reports
--------

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/issues) section to
report any bugs or feature requests and to see the list of known issues. Before you report a bug, take a look [here](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-Report-Bug).  

Limitations
-----------

* A firewall cannot protect against attacks that are performed outside the operating point. For example, if there is a Point-to-Point connection to the Internet.
* The firewall cannot prevent corporate data from being copied to a memory stick or HDD and these are removed from the building. 
* AFWall+ does not scan for virus/malware that may exist in the files that pass through it, because a firewall is not an antivirus solution.

Compatibility
-------------

AFWall+ has been success tested with Android version 4.xx - 5. (ICS, JellyBean, KitKat, Lollipop) and is reported to work with most Android variants, including stock ROMs.

I do not recommend using AFWall+ in combination with any of the similar solutions because this could result in conflicts and potential data leaks (iptables could be overwritten).

Upgrading
---------

* **Make a backup** (e.g. with Titanium Backup)
* **Do not remove the previous version** (or else your settings might get lost)
* Download the new version
* Install the new version over the previous version
* Done!

Permissions
-----------

AFWall+ asks for the following Android permissions:

* RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: Autostart (Bootup) AFWall+ after the system finishes booting.
* ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Allows AFWall+ to access information about networks (iptables).
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Allows AFWall+ to write to external storage for debug log and export iptables rules.
* ACCESS_SUPERUSER: Standard to support Superuser/SuperSU (by Koushik/Chainfire).
* INTERNET: NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces() needs android.permission.INTERNET. This is just being used to get the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses/subnets for each interface, so the LAN address ranges can be determined. Nothing is actually trying to access the network. Also take a look at [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17252018/getting-my-lan-ip-address-192-168-xxxx-ipv4).
* ACCESS_WIFI_STATE: Used to detect tether state.

Compile AFWall+
---------------

Prerequisites:

* Android SDK in your $PATH (both platform-tools/ and tools/ directories)
* Javac 1.7 (or higher) and a recent version of Apache ant in your $PATH
* Git in your $PATH
* Use the Android SDK Manager to install API 19 (or higher)

Quick start:

    git clone git://github.com/ukanth/afwall
    cd afwall
    ./gradlew clean assembleDebug

For complete instructions, please take a look at the [Wiki | HOWTO-Compile-AFWall](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-Compile-AFWall).

## Compiling Native Binaries

On host side you'll need to install:

* [NDK r10](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html), nominally under /opt/android-ndk-r10
* Host-side gcc 4.7, make, etc. (Red Hat "Development Tools" group or Debian build-essential)
* autoconf, automake, and libtool

This command will build the Android binaries and copy them into res/raw/:

    make -C external NDK=/opt/android-ndk-r10
