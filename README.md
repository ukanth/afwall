Description

Bug Reports
-----------

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/issues) section to
report any bugs, make feature requests, and to see the list of known issues. Before you report a bug, take a look [here](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-Report-Bug).

Limitations
-----------

* A firewall cannot protect against attacks that are performed outside the operating point. For example, if there is a Point-to-Point connection to the Internet.
* A firewall cannot prevent corporate data from being copied to a memory stick or HDD, and having these removed from the building.
* AFWall+ does not scan for virus/malware that may exist in the files that pass through it, because it is a firewall and not an antivirus solution.

Compatibility
-------------

AFWall+ has been successfully tested with Android versions 4.x - 7.x. (ICS, JellyBean, KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow, Nougat) and is reported to work with most Android variants, including stock ROMs.

We do not recommend using AFWall+ in combination with any of the similar solutions because this could result in conflicts and potential data leaks (iptables could get overwritten).

Upgrading
---------

* **Make a backup of the current version** (e.g. using Titanium Backup).
* **Do not remove the current version** (otherwise your settings might get reset).
* Download the new version.
* Install the new version over the previous version.
* Done!

Permissions
-----------

AFWall+ asks for the following Android permissions:

* RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: Autostart (Bootup) AFWall+ after the system finishes booting.
* ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Allows AFWall+ to access information about networks (iptables).
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Allows AFWall+ to write to external storage for debug log and export iptables rules.
* ACCESS_SUPERUSER: Standard to support Superuser/SuperSU (by Koushik/Chainfire).
* INTERNET: NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces() needs android.permission.INTERNET. This is just being used to get the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses/subnets for each interface, so the LAN address ranges can be determined. Nothing is actually trying to access the network. Also take a look at [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17252018/getting-my-lan-ip-address-192-168-xxxx-ipv4).
* ACCESS_WIFI_STATE: Used to detect the tether state.

Compile AFWall+
---------------

Prerequisites:

* Android SDK in your $PATH (both platform-tools/ and tools/ directories)
* Javac 1.7 (or higher) and a recent version of Apache ant in your $PATH
* Git in your $PATH
* Use the Android SDK Manager to install API 19 (or higher)

Quick start:

    git clone git://github.com/ukanth/afwall
    cd afwall
    ./gradlew clean assembleDebug

For complete instructions, please take a look at the [Wiki's How To Compile AFWAll section](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-Compile-AFWall).

## Compiling Native Binaries

On the host side, you will need to install:

* [NDK r10](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html), nominally under /opt/android-ndk-r10
* Host-side gcc 4.7, make, etc. (Red Hat 'Development Tools' group or Debian build-essential)
* autoconf, automake, and libtool

This command will build the Android binaries and copy them into `res/raw/`:

    make -C external NDK=/opt/android-ndk-r10
