	 * to the output. STDOUT and STDERR are thus not guaranteed to be in the correct
	 * order in the output.
	 * 
	 * Note as well that this code will intentionally crash when run in debug mode 
	 * from the main thread of the application. You should always execute shell 
	 * commands from a background thread.
	 * 
	 * When in debug mode, the code will also excessively log the commands passed to
	 * and the output returned from the shell.
	 * 
	 * Though this function uses background threads to gobble STDOUT and STDERR so
	 * a deadlock does not occur if the shell produces massive output, the output is
	 * still stored in a List<String>, and as such doing something like "ls -lR /"
	 * will probably have you run out of memory.

	 * @param wantSTDERR Return STDERR in the output ?
