<div class="warning">
    <span><strong>Q: Why do I see data traffic for an app that is blocked by AFWall+?</strong></span>
</div>
<div class="block">
 <span>A: It's possibly false data traffic. AFWall+ uses IPtables which is at the kernel level (low-level).<br>
	Data use shown by Android is calculated before it gets dropped by the firewall.

<div class="warning">
 <span><strong>Q: Why does my entire network seem to be blocked after I enabled the experimental 'Fix Startup Data Leak' option?</strong></span>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <span>A: Please uncheck that option (this will remove the init.d file automatically).<br>
  It is under Preferences - Experimental preferences - 'Fix startup data leak'.<br>
  In case you uninstalled AFWall+ and copied the script manually, ensure it is removed: the file is called 'afwallstart'.</span>
